## Research Experience (details-list)
Id: research
### University of Tokyo — H. Liang Nuclear Theory Group (2025–Present)
Paragraph: How humans can make a safe and efficient use of nuclei – such as through fission and fusion processes – is a difficult question, requiring a deep microscopic understanding of quantum many-body theories. The treatment of long-lived fission products by nuclear power plants depends strongly on the specifics of quantum many-body tunneling, a long-standing problem that requires a first principles (ab initio) theory of properties of nuclei. While there are many established microscopic nuclear theories, the only approach applicable to almost the whole nuclear chart is Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our work uses modern theoretical tools such as Effective Field Theory (EFT) and Renormalization Group (RG) Flow to construct such an ab initio nuclear DFT.

Note: Supported by UTRIP 2025 and FUTI Global Leadership Award.
### UCLA — Z. Bern & M. Solon Scattering Amplitudes Group (2025–Present)
Paragraph: Project TBD.

Note: Supported by Mani L. Bhaumik Institute for Theoretical Physics Summer 2025 Research Fellowship and 2025 - 2026 UCLA URSP.
### UCLA — E.P. Alves Plasma Theory Group (2024–2025)
Paragraph: Developed novel ML-based methods for studying time-dependent particle acceleration in relativistic astrophysical jets. My work resolves longstanding limitations of standard models by combining analytic theory and machine learning to uniquely solve ill-posed problems for the first time. Demonstrated that simple energy-dependent models are insufficient to explain the observed nonthermal particle spectrum and that these novel ML methods can be generalized to solve a large class of ill-posed problems—uniquely identifying physical solutions from an infinite family of solutions that perfectly reconstruct the data. Presented results at an international plasma physics conference, where my contributed oral talk initiated discussions toward new collaborations and research directions.

Note: Supported by UCLA Physics Summer 2024 Research Fellowship.
### UCLA — B.C. Regan Condensed Matter Group (2024)
Paragraph: Pedagogical contributions in proving the Feynman Checkerboard at a level suitable for undergraduates, illuminating an accessible way to teach propagators.
